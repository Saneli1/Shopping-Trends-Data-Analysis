This project analyzes consumer shopping trends using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and SQL queries. It explores customer demographics, purchase behavior, and transaction details.

Project Overview
Python Analysis (Jupyter Notebook):
Reads and processes the shopping_trends.csv dataset.
Performs basic data exploration (row count, column count, headers).
Cleans and prepares data for analysis.

SQL Queries:
Analyzes age distribution of customers.
Segments customers into different age groups.
Aggregates purchase behavior based on demographic data.

Technologies Used
Python: Data processing using loops, conditionals, and string operations.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for writing and executing Python code.
SQL: Structured queries to analyze and extract insights.
CSV Files: Used as the raw data source.
